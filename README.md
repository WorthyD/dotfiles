# dotfiles

## Cloned from https://github.com/RaulMurillo/dotfiles

Preferences prevent me from wanting to fork it.


Clone using `git clone https://github.com/worthyhd/dotfiles.git`.

To symlink install run `makesymlinks.sh`.

It includes VSCode configurations, which must be installed with `install-vscode-extensions.sh` and `copy_settings.sh` from the [vscode](vscode) folder.

Also, includes the shell prompt based on [synth-shell-prompt](https://github.com/andresgongora/synth-shell-prompt). It is recommended to install *power-line fonts* and *hack-ttf* in the graphical interface accessing the system. The prompt customization can be disabled from the [bashrc](bashrc#L117).
